# Python_ColorConsole
Library to produce coloured Console applications with lines, boxes menus and controlled user input
This is the second of a number of related tutorials to improve the appearance of Console based projects.

It is aimed at students for projects where a full GUI is not used, and a coloured menu, input box, and other features are included.
A .pdf file, and a Youtube video is planned.

The versions for C#, Lua and Java are now complete.
